# Quizlet to Anki
Quizlet is a website that allows users to access other user-submitted flash card decks. Anki is an application that shows users different flash cards based on spaced repetition. There is no built-in way to convert these flash card decks to Anki decks and many of the other programs made to do this have stopped working because Quizlet's API no longer works. This program uses a workaround which uses a PDF export of a Quizlet deck to convert into an Anki deck.

# Running Quizlet to Anki
1. Download the latest version of Quizlet to Anki from the releases.
2. On the page for the flash card deck that you want to export, click the ellipses next to the "Share" button and click "Print".

3. Select Glossary and save it as a PDF. You might need to use a different browser if you're not given the option to save as a PDF.
